# CNN_SpaceRadioClassfication

##This has been done as a project under Coursera named "Classify Radio Signals from Space using Keras" to help understand CNN and the implementation of classification techniques on SETI outer Space datasets using the following technologies:


 1. Numpy
 2. Pandas
 3. Matplotlib
 4. Tensorflow (Dense, Input, MaxPooling, Adam optimization)
 5. Keras
 
 This project undergoes the following tasks throughout the way:
 1. Importing datasets
 2. Plotting 2D Spectrograms to get a comparison ground for the CNN
 3. Creating training and validation data generators
 4. Developing the CNN model after importing necessary utilities (eg. optimizers, layers, model, callbacks etc.)
 5. Scheduling the learning rate and compiled model
 6. Training the model
 7. Evaluating the model
